# GCP-Cloud-Run-Nodejs-App
In this project I deployed a containerized NodeJs application using Cloud Run. I setup continuous deployment by linking Github repository to Cloud Source Repositories and added a Cloud Build Trigger to automatically builds and deploys an updated docker image to Cloud Run. I also used Google Domains to setup a custom domain name for my application.
