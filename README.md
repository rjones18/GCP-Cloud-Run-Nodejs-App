# GCP-Cloud-Run-Nodejs-App
In this project, I have successfully implemented a containerized NodeJs application deployment on the Cloud Run platform. I achieved this by configuring continuous deployment, which involves establishing a linkage between the Github repository and Cloud Source Repositories. Furthermore, I integrated a Cloud Build Trigger into the process to automatically generate and deploy updated docker images to Cloud Run. To enhance the project's accessibility and usability, I leveraged Google Domains to create and assign a custom domain name to the application.
